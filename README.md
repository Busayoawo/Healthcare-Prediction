# Healthcare-Prediction
1. Predictive Modeling: Build a linear regression model to predict `charges` based on all the other variables in the dataset. What is the performance of the model?
2. Clustering: Perform a cluster analysis to segment customers based on their features. What distinct segments can you identify?
3. Hypothesis Testing: Is there a statistically significant difference in average insurance costs between regions? Use an ANOVA test to validate this.
4. Feature Engineering: Create interaction terms for `smoker` status and `bmi`, and assess if they improve a predictive model for `charges`.
5. Decision Trees: Create a decision tree to understand the key factors that lead to higher insurance charges. What are the main splitting variables?
